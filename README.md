=============================================================================
FIREBASE SECURITY RULES
=============================================================================

Key Security Principles:
1. Students can only read/write their own data
2. Only authenticated users can access content
3. Admins have full access
4. Single active session enforcement
5. Video URLs and PDF URLs should be token-protected

Example Rules:
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "live_classes": {
      ".read": "auth != null && root.child('users/' + auth.uid + '/is_live').val() == true"
    },
    "recorded_classes": {
      ".read": "auth != null && root.child('users/' + auth.uid + '/is_recorded_class').val() == true"
    }
  }
}

=============================================================================
ONESIGNAL INTEGRATION
=============================================================================

Setup:
1. Create OneSignal app
2. Add OneSignal SDK to website
3. Implement player ID storage in Firebase

Notification Triggers:
- New announcement published
- Live class scheduled
- Live class starting in 10 minutes
- Quiz deadline approaching
- Mock test available
- Registration approved
- Upgrade approved
- Account logged in from another device (logout notification)

Implementation:
- On user login, get OneSignal player ID
- Store player ID in Firebase user profile
- Send targeted notifications based on:
  * Player ID (individual)
  * Tags (package type, subjects)
  * Segments (all users, live users, recorded users)

Session Management with OneSignal:
- On login, send silent notification to previous device
- Previous device receives notification and logs out
- Current device continues with new session

=============================================================================
GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT INTEGRATION
=============================================================================

Script Functions:

1. uploadTransactionScreenshot():
   - Receives base64 image from registration form
   - Uploads to specific Google Drive folder
   - Returns Drive file URL
   - Appends data to Google Sheets

2. Google Sheets Structure:
   - Sheet Name: "New Registrations"
   - Columns: Timestamp, Name, Email, Mobile, WhatsApp, DOB, Graduation Year, Package, Transaction Screenshot URL, Status
   - Each form submission creates new row

3. Apps Script Endpoint:
   - Deploy as web app
   - Accept POST requests from website
   - Return JSON response with Drive URL and status

Implementation in Website:
- On form submit, send data to Apps Script endpoint
- Receive Drive URL
- Store URL in Firebase
- Show success message to user

=============================================================================
EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS
